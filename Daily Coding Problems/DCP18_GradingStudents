/*
HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a  in the inclusive range from  to .
Any  less than  is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's  according to these rules:

If the difference between the  and the next multiple of  is less than , round  up to the next multiple of .
If the value of  is less than , no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
For example,  will be rounded to  but  will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than .

Given the initial value of  for each of Sam's  students, write code to automate the rounding process.

Function Description

gradingStudents has the following parameter(s):

grades: an array of integers representing grades before rounding
Input Format
